Loku Project Name: Stock Market Analysis and Visualization

Overview

This project analyzes stock market data from various countries and visualizes global and regional stock trends over the past few decades. The data is processed, cleaned, and analyzed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and MongoDB. The visualizations are intended to provide insights into stock market performance, both globally and regionally, with a focus on trends from 1995 to 2024.

Steps to Use and Interact with the Project

Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Install Dependencies: The project requires the following Python libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
mpld3
pymongo

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib mpld3 pymongo


Prepare the Data:
The data is stored in an Excel file (Stock Markets, US$.xlsx).
Update the file path in the code to point to your file.
The data is cleaned, including renaming columns, handling missing values, and saving the cleaned data as a new Excel file (cleaned_stock_data.xlsx).

Run the Analysis: 
The analysis is done in the Jupyter notebook. 
To run the analysis:
Open the Jupyter notebook.
Execute the code block by block.


View the Visualizations: 
After running the analysis, three visualizations will be generated:
Global Stock Trends (1995-2024): A line plot showing the global average and median stock values.
Regional Stock Trends (1995-2024): A stacked plot visualizing stock trends for different regions (e.g., Europe, North America, Asia).
Average Regional Stock Values (1995-2024): A bar plot showing the average stock value for each region.

The plots will be saved as PNG files and HTML files (for interactivity).
MongoDB Integration: The project integrates MongoDB to store and manage the data. Ensure MongoDB is set up locally or use a cloud database. Modify the connection details in the code as needed.




This project ensures the ethical handling of data by:
Using publicly available stock market data.
Ensuring that no sensitive or private information is included in the analysis.
Taking steps to clean the data appropriately to avoid biases or inaccuracies.
Additionally, the project adheres to open-source principles, and all code and data sources used are referenced accordingly.

Data Source(s)

Stock market data is sourced from the Excel file Stock Markets, US$.xlsx available on the project directory. The data spans multiple years (1995-2024) for various countries.
